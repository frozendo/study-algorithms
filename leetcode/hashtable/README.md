# Hash Table

Hash Table data structure (also known as a dictionary, associative array, or map) is defined as a data structure that stores a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is associated with a single value. 

Maps provide an efficient way to store and retrieve data based on a unique identifier (the key).
It is an essential data structure in computer science because it allows for efficient and fast lookups, inserts, and deletes.

## Where to use

1. **Sliding Windows:** where we need a sliding window to find something, we might improve the complexity using hash table.
